## Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹
My name is Amneris Calle and I am studying Full Stack Development at Coderhouse.
I've got a degree as a Civil Engineer but only worked for two years after finishing my studies. Life had me follow other paths, however, computing and programming have always been my favourite hobby, which I hope I can now turn into a new career.
The last course of the 4 that make up the Full Stack Development career have just begun and I am looking forward to learning a lot, finishing the course and starting a new life :)
You can visit each of the 3 final projects that I've developed during the courses in the list of repositories.
