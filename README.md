## Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹
My name is Amneris Calle and I am studying Full Stack Development at Coderhouse.
I'v got a degree as a Civil Engineer but only worked for two years. Life had me follow other paths, however, computing and programming have always been my favourite hobby, which I hope I can now turn into a new career.
I am looking forward to finishing the project I am currently working on: a full 5-page website developed 100% by myself using all the methodology learnt in the Web Developement course, which is the first of 5 courses that make up the Full Stack Developement career.
